### Building infrastructure for a post-scarcity world.

Decentralize commerce. Decentralize governance. Democratize expertise. Keep resources in circulation. That's the thesis. These are the pieces:

[**OrangeCat**](https://github.com/g-but/orangecat) — Bitcoin-native commerce and funding. No banks, no middlemen. [orangecat.ch](https://orangecat.ch)

[**Solon**](https://github.com/g-but/solon) — Transparent governance. Treasury on-chain, votes cryptographically signed, decisions tracked against KPIs.

[**Botsmann**](https://github.com/g-but/botsmann) — Domain-specialized AI professionals. Legal, medical, research, translation. [botsmann.vercel.app](https://botsmann.vercel.app)

[**RevampIT**](https://github.com/g-but/revampit) — Digital infrastructure for a Zurich nonprofit keeping technology in circulation. [revamp-it.ch](https://revamp-it.ch)

[**SBB Lost & Found**](https://github.com/g-but/sbb-lost-found) — 1.2M items lost per year on Swiss trains. 24h → 30min.

[**Reparaturbonus ZH**](https://github.com/g-but/reparaturbonus-zh) — City of Zurich repair bonus. Repair over replace.

I decide what's worth building. AI does the rest.
