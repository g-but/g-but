### Decentralization. Automation. Abundance.

Blockchain removes the need to trust institutions. AI removes the need for repetitive labor. Robotics removes the need for human drudgery. Together, they don't just improve the current system — they make it obsolete. We are entering the technological singularity, and the result is a society of sustainable abundance.

I build the infrastructure for that transition.

#### The Work

**Decentralized Finance & Governance**

[**OrangeCat**](https://github.com/g-but/orangecat) — Bitcoin-native commerce, funding, and community platform. Entity Registry SSOT drives 13 entity types from one config file. All prices in satoshis (BigInt, no floats). Lightning Network payments. Row Level Security at the database level.

[**Solon**](https://github.com/g-but/solon) — Cryptographic democracy. Treasury transactions on-chain, votes signed with Bitcoin keys, decisions tracked against KPIs. Replaces trust with math.

**AI & Autonomous Systems**

[**Botsmann**](https://github.com/g-but/botsmann) — Multi-LLM routing across Groq, OpenRouter, and local Ollama. Six domain-specialized AI professionals with scoped knowledge bases. RAG via pgvector with zero-cost client-side embeddings. Four-layer prompt injection defense.

**Sustainability & Circular Economy**

[**RevampIT**](https://github.com/g-but/revampit) — Swiss nonprofit redistributing technology instead of discarding it. Custom CMS, 165 table constants as SSOT, 312 tests. Open-source because that's what a circular economy looks like in software.

[**SBB Lost & Found**](https://github.com/g-but/sbb-lost-found) — Real-time lost item recovery for Swiss railways. Microservice architecture, Redis pub/sub, Socket.io live notifications. Collapses recovery time from 24 hours to 30 minutes.

[**Reparaturbonus Zürich**](https://github.com/g-but/reparaturbonus-zh) — Government repair bonus platform. Connecting residents with certified repair shops instead of landfills. Repair over replace.
