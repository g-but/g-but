### Give me a hard problem and a cup of tea.

Bitcoin, AI, real-time systems, government platforms, nonprofit ops. I go where the interesting problems are, figure them out from first principles, and ship. Life's too short for best practices that nobody can explain.

#### The Work

These aren't separate projects. They're all pieces of the same thing.

[**OrangeCat**](https://github.com/g-but/orangecat) — Commerce without banks. Funding without intermediaries. Community without platforms taking a cut. OrangeCat is economic infrastructure for a post-middleman world, built on Bitcoin and Lightning Network. One Entity Registry config drives 13 entity types across the entire app. [orangecat.ch](https://orangecat.ch)

[**Solon**](https://github.com/g-but/solon) — If OrangeCat decentralizes commerce, Solon decentralizes power. Every treasury transaction on-chain, every vote cryptographically signed, every decision tracked against KPIs. Governance you can verify instead of trust. Four voting mechanisms, five transparency metrics. If it can't be verified, it doesn't count.

[**Botsmann**](https://github.com/g-but/botsmann) — Legal advice, medical guidance, research, translation used to be locked behind expensive professionals. Botsmann makes that expertise accessible through six domain-specialized AI professionals, each with their own scoped knowledge base. Routes across Groq, OpenRouter, and local Ollama so you're never locked into one provider. [botsmann.vercel.app](https://botsmann.vercel.app)

[**RevampIT**](https://github.com/g-but/revampit) — Abundance doesn't mean infinite production. It means efficiently distributing what already exists. RevampIT is a real nonprofit in Zurich that keeps technology in circulation instead of sending it to landfills. I'm building the digital infrastructure for the entire operation: inventory, P2P marketplace, workshops, services, staff coordination, meeting protocols, IT support (IT-Hilfe), and a fundraising intelligence platform (revamp-info) that tracks 15,000+ Swiss foundations. 165 table constants because real-world operations are messy. 312 tests because they have to actually work. [revamp-it.ch](https://revamp-it.ch)

[**SBB Lost & Found**](https://github.com/g-but/sbb-lost-found) — 1.2 million items lost per year on Swiss trains. Current system takes 24 hours. This gets it down to 30 minutes by connecting passengers directly with train staff in real-time. Redis pub/sub, Socket.io, microservices.

[**Reparaturbonus Zürich**](https://github.com/g-but/reparaturbonus-zh) — City of Zurich repair bonus platform. Same philosophy as RevampIT: repair over replace. Connecting residents with certified repair shops instead of landfills.

#### How I Think

I start with the problem, not the tools. What are the actual constraints? What's the simplest thing that works within them? If the only reason to do something is "that's how other projects do it," it's not a reason.

Every piece of data gets one home. Types come from schemas. Config drives behavior. If adding a field means touching 5 files, the architecture needs fixing.

I don't build for hypothetical future requirements. Three lines of similar code beats a premature abstraction every time. Complexity has to justify itself.

Machines are better than humans at almost everything now. Architecture, UX, product decisions, code, testing. The only thing left that's uniquely human is deciding what's worth building in the first place. I do that part. My army of robots does the rest.

If you're the kind of person who reads architecture docs for fun, start with [`.claude/rules/`](https://github.com/g-but/orangecat/tree/main/.claude/rules) in OrangeCat. 5,500 lines. You're welcome.

#### Where this is going

Decentralize commerce. Decentralize governance. Democratize expertise. Keep resources in circulation. Solve real problems in real-time. Stack all of that and you get a world that runs on abundance instead of scarcity. We're closer than most people realize.

When I'm not commanding robots, I'm probably listening to or making electronic music and thinking about the next problem worth solving.
